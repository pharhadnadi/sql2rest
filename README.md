# sql2rest 
latest of version zero.
This project is particularly tested for MSSQL SERVER and is capable o generate RESTful APIs with ONLY GET verbs and up to one parameter.
API generation would be through reading a JSON file that contain dB connection  info and multiple queries that will be translated into different methods  of API.
By building the docker image, each API will run on as container.
